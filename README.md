# 🧠 AI-Powered Mission Readiness Prediction Tool

This project applies machine learning to predict mission readiness status based on key operational variables such as logistics delays, personnel availability, equipment conditions, weather severity, and mission type. It’s inspired by real-world defense operations and built to demonstrate how AI can support smarter planning and resource allocation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

As a transitioning Navy Corpsman with experience training Marines and Seabees and evaluating tactical operations, I designed this project to merge that experience with the power of data-driven decision-making.

The model predicts whether a mission will be classified as:
- ✅ Ready
- ⚠️ Delayed
- 🔴 Critical

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Random Forest Classifier
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Features
- Simulated dataset of 500 mission scenarios
- Encoded weather and mission types
- Cleaned and split data for training/testing
- Built and evaluated classification model
- Feature importance analysis
- Visual breakdown of readiness by mission type

## 📌 Next Steps
- Add dashboard integration (Streamlit/Power BI)
- Extend to real-world datasets or defense simulations
- Test with additional ML algorithms

## 👋 Let’s Connect
If you're working at the intersection of defense, AI, or logistics — I’d love to connect and collaborate.
