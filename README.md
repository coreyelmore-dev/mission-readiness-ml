# 🧠 Mission Readiness Prediction Tool

This machine learning project predicts mission readiness using simulated defense logistics and operational data. It demonstrates how AI can support smarter planning, resource allocation, and readiness forecasting in high-stakes environments.

## 🚀 Project Overview

> Predicts whether a mission is **Ready**, **Delayed**, or **Critical** based on:
- Supply delay days
- Personnel availability
- Equipment status score
- Weather severity
- Mission type

Built using:
- ✅ Python
- ✅ Pandas / NumPy
- ✅ Scikit-learn
- ✅ Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📊 Visuals and Performance

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|--------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Random Forest       | 1.00     | 1.00      | 1.00   | 1.00     |
| Logistic Regression | 0.75     | 0.75      | 0.75   | 0.75     |
